# **Hide n' Seek: Hide Promoted Jobs & Companies**

![A promotional marquee. The logo and name are featured on the left side of the marquee. The logo is a simple drawing of a briefcase, bisected diagonally, with one side a light-brown color and the other side a black color. The face of a black cat with yellow eyes is partially visible as it peeks around the brown edge of the diagonal bisection. A "before and after" diagram on the right side of the marquee shows how the extension hides jobs and is titled "View the jobs you seek. Hide the ones you don't"](/images/promotional-marquee-2-normalized.svg)

## **Description**

**Hide n' Seek** lets you easily remove promoted job postings and companies from your search results on LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor.

</a>

## **How It Works**

“Block” buttons are added next to every listing. If you see a listing you don’t like, simply click the button to hide it. By default, the listing will be hidden under an overlay. Alternatively, you can completely eliminate it from search results by enabling the “Do not display hidden jobs” option.

To hide promoted jobs, click the “block” button on any promoted listing and then activate the “Promoted” toggle.

For easy management, you can view a list of everything you've hidden by clicking the Hide n’ Seek button on your browser’s toolbar.

## **Usage**

- Get started by clicking the Hide n' Seek button on the browser's toolbar. Select a job board, enter a job name, and then click the search button. You may also go directly to a supported job board's website to perform your search if you prefer.

- Click a job's "block" button and all jobs by that company will be hidden behind an overlay.

- Click a job's "unblock" button to remove the overlays.

- Click the toolbar button for additional options:
  - Scroll through your list of hidden jobs and click a hidden job's name to remove it.
  - Click the "Unhide all jobs" button to reset your hidden jobs list. This action can be undone by clicking the "Undo" button.
  - Click the "Do not display hidden jobs" button to remove hidden jobs from display, rather than hide them behind overlays.

## **Supported Job Boards**

- Glassdoor
- Indeed
- LinkedIn

## **Privacy Policy**

Your data remains completely private and is never shared. All data is stored locally on your device and may sync across your devices if browser synchronization is enabled.

## **Permissions**

The following permissions are required:

- "Read and change your data on all indeed.com sites and all linkedin.com sites"
  - Enables the addition of "Block" buttons and other UI elements to listings.
- "Read your browsing history"
  - Enables the detection of LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor so the extension can look for listings.

Note that the above permissions are written exactly as Chrome displays them to the user during installation. Other browsers will ask for the same permissions, but the wording may vary.

## **Download**

- [Chrome Web Store **(Recommended)**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hide-n-seek-hide-promoted/agghbaheofcoecndkbflbnggdjcmiaml)
- [Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/hide-n-seek/lnfbapfcdippajlhlmefaabhkdbmgiog)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-n-seek/)

Edge users: I recommend that you download from the Chrome Web Store because it releases extension updates much faster than Edge Add-ons (1-2 days versus 2–4 weeks).

## **How It Was Made**

Hide n' Seek was written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No libraries or frameworks were used.

Graphic artwork was drawn with BoxySVG.

The promotional video was created with a combination of Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere Pro.

- 4.1.2
  - Release date
    - 2023-04-18
  - Bug fixes
    - UI not showing
      - Some code optimizations seem to have reduced the frequency of [this issue](https://github.com/damianmgarcia/Hide-n-Seek/issues/11). However, the [source of this bug may be Chrome itself](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1426461).
    - Popup scrollbar not visible when page zoom is greater than 100%
      - Previously, the popup's main (body) scrollbar, which is only necessary when page zoom is greater than 100%, was available, but not visible, because it was black on top of a black background. Now the scrollbar is visible so that users with a page zoom greater than 100% can easily use it.
- 4.1.1
  - Release date
    - 2023-02-24
  - Bug fixes
    - UI not showing
      - See details [here](https://github.com/damianmgarcia/Hide-n-Seek/pull/5)

    - Added support for the signed-out version of LinkedIn's job search
      - The extension is now compatible with the signed-out version of LinkedIn's job search.
- 4.0.0
  - Release date
    - 2023-02-14

  - Bug fixes
    - UI not showing on LinkedIn after clicking browser's back or forward buttons
      - A MutationObserver for detecting jobs would sometimes stop working during back/forward web navigation on LinkedIn because LinkedIn would remove the element that the observer was observing. This issue has been resolved.
- 3.1.0
  - Release date
    - 2023-02-03
  - Improvements
    - Added Firefox support
      - Firefox 109, released 2023-01-17, added support for Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extensions.
      - [Firefox's handling of permissions for MV3 extensions is broken](https://github.com/w3c/webextensions/issues/119#issuecomment-965799707). Unlike other browsers, Firefox does not ask users to grant permissions during installation, nor does it make it obvious enough to users that permissions are needed even when they search for jobs on a supported job board. Instead, users must take additional steps after installation to grant necessary permissions. This is an unfortunate user experience. Therefore, publication to Firefox Add-ons has been suspended until Firefox resolves this issue.

  - Release date
    - 2023-02-01

- 2.0.0
  - Release date
    - 2023-01-21
  - New features
    - Remove hidden jobs from display
      - The extension's browser button popup includes a new toggle button, "Do not display hidden jobs", that lets you remove hidden jobs from view, rather than hide them behind overlays.
    - Hidden jobs tally
      - The toolbar button now includes a tally of hidden jobs. The tally increases or decreases by 1 each time a company is hidden or unhidden, respectively. It also increases or decreases by 1 if promoted or sponsored jobs are hidden or unhidden, respectively. A simple breakdown of the tally is displayed when your cursor hovers over the extension's browser button.
  - Improvements
    - No more delay when unhiding all jobs
      - Clicking the "Unhide all jobs" button (or its "Undo" button) now produces instantaneous results across all active tabs and windows. Previously, there was a short delay.
